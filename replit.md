## Overview

Mona is a React-based health and wellness application that provides personalized insights from health data to help optimize user wellness journeys. The app focuses on health metrics like sleep, readiness, and activity while providing nutritional guidance and progress tracking.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Single-page application with component-based navigation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- **Production**: esbuild for server bundling

### Database & Storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (via Neon serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with memory fallback
